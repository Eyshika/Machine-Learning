I have implemented thin plate spline algorithm, by using 2 face images and warp one face on another.

Warping an image is a transormation which inolves mapping pixels from source position to destination positions.

Thin Plate Spline is a Spline based technique. It refers to the bending of thin sheet of metal. The process of using TPS in image warping involves minimizing
a bending energy function for a tranformation over a set of given nodes or landmark points.
